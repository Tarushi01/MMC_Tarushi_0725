<h1>Login Component</h1>
<p>Secure login systems are essential in online banking to protect user data and prevent fraud.
    Secure login systems are the backbone of online banking. They enable users to access their 
    accounts through encrypted portals using credentials like usernames, passwords, and 
    increasingly, biometric data. Modern banking platforms integrate multi-factor authentication 
    and session tracking to prevent unauthorized access. The evolution of login technology—from 
    simple password entry to fingerprint and facial recognition—reflects the industry's commitment 
    to balancing convenience with robust cybersecurity
